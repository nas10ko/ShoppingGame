# ShoppingGame
TLDR: 1v1 someone by shopping for items as fast as possible
- 2 Players get a random list of items they need to collect, and they try to race eachother to collect those items first. They can also set down traps and blockades for eachother, so that it's harder for the other person to get their items. Whoever collected all their items, or had the more items when the time ran out, wins. 

## Current To-Do list:
- Splitscreen
- Movement of both players
- Random Shopping list creator
- Item Pickup
- Timer
- Store Layout + Game Art
- Powerups (?)
